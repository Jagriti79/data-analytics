Welcome to my **Data Analytics Portfolio**, a curated collection of real-world mini-projects that demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

Each project is housed in its own folder with:
- Jupyter notebooks or dashboards
- Cleaned datasets (or dataset references)
- A dedicated `README.md` explaining the goal, approach, and key insights
